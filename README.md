Exploring book highlights in different ways

Flow:
- Upload a markdown file with book highlights
- The file is parsed using markdown and bs4 to get only highlights text
- Highlights are then store in sqlite

Next Steps:
- Make the highlights searchable. Local search engine or something using sqlite?
- How to get insights through it?
